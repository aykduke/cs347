1. The website was very clear on it's purpose. The information provided was interesting and important to the main idea for the website. The colors and layout were appealing as well.

2. All of the pages had the same format and same color scheme. Mine on the other hand had a somewhat different format for the home page and the feedback page, while my information pages stuck to the same format. I think user experience can be interperted in a few different ways. Some may enjoy mine more because I have loud flashy and sometimes changing colors. This website was a little more clean and calm. This website may have a more maintainable codebase for that reason. With the format remaining the same, It would be easy to make adjustments or add new pages with the same format.

3. I thought the html code and css code within the files were very well structured. Everything is easy to follow along with when looking at the code. The style.css file is not in it's own directory but that fine because it's the only css file in the projcet.

4. I did notice that when the webpage is shortened that in a couple places the words from a paragraph may run over some other words in a different box. But generally everything looked great. The elements were used appropriately as far as I can tell and the CSS seems perfectly refactored to avoid duplication.

5. Great website and very interesting topic!!
