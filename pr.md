What did you like about this website?
    I really liked the layout it's really well constructed, and I liked the color choices.

Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.

Which has a better user experience (and why)?
    I think their website has better user experience since there is a consistent structure to the website where only the middle panel changes on each page.

Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories? 
    Yes, the code is very well structured and all the of the files were easy to locate and identify.

Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them. 
    The only problem I saw was that come of the content overflows from its container when the page is resized.

Were semantically appropriate elements selected?
    Not really, I think it would've been better to use some more semantically appropriate containers like head, main, and footer, instead of using divs for everything.

Is the CSS refactored to limit duplicaton?
    Yes, so much so that there is only one CSS file for the whole website.

Do you have any other constructive comments for the author? 
    The only critiques I had were to use semantic tags within the HTML, and ustilize some media queries to make sure things resize a bit better. Otherwise it's a really great looking website!
